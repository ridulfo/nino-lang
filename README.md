**Minimal interpreted functional programming language**

Like the [Whippet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whippet), this language [will have] the highest running speed of any [language] of its [size].

The goal is to create a small language that only has the essential features needed to be able to do pretty much anything. No bloat. This will make [self-hosting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)>) easier and faster.

In this spirit, the under the hood type system is minimal. There are only 4 types:
- `u8` (unsigned 8-bit integer): this is used for booleans and characters
- `float` (64-bit floating point number): this is used for numbers
- `fn` (function): this is used for functions
- `array`: will be an array of any of the above types

The user will however be able to use `true` and `false`, which will be converted to `u8` values of `1` and `0` respectively. 

The language is chill with side effects. There is no need to wrap anything in monads.

At the moment the language is interpreted, but the goal is to create a self-hosting compiler. TBD whether to compile to assembly or [LLVM IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM#Intermediate_representation).

There is no garbage collector (TBD ðŸ¤¨).

## Current status

- 2023-10-13: Just finished defining the initial complete syntax. Next is to rewrite the lexer, parser and code generator to support the new syntax.
- 2023-10-15: Syntax has been reworked and a grammar definition can be found in [docs](docs/grammar.md). The lexer has been updated to support the new syntax and the parser has been completely rewritten as a recursive descent parser. A code generated has been implemented that can generate LLVM IR. The next steps are to implement more language features. See [milestones](#milestones) for more details.
- 2023-10-17: Created compiler program
- 2023-10-22: Implemented declaring and calling functions. Function calls can be used as values in an expression. The next steps will need to be refactoring and adding unit tests.
- 2023-10-28: Re-wrote the lexer and parser to rust. Added tons of unit tests. Created an interpreter to run `.ni` files.
- 2023-10-29: Any programming language's most important features is correctness and safety. No need for more justification.
- 2023-10-04: Added tail-call optimization. More complex computations are now possible.

## Quick start

**Compile the interpreter**

```Bash
cargo build --release && mv target/release/ninoi .
```

**Run the example program**

```Bash
./ninoi examples/print-sum.ni
```


## Syntax

Grammar definition can be found in [here](docs/grammar.md).

Check the [examples](examples) directory for the currently supported syntax.

### Examples

```Rust
let is_prime_helper:fn = (x:i32, i:i32):bool => true ? {
    x==i => true,
    x mod i == 0 => false,
    is_prime_helper(x, i + 1)
};

let is_prime:fn = (x:i32):bool => x ? {
    1 => false,
    2 => true,
    is_prime_helper(x, 2)
};

print(is_prime(2));
print(is_prime(3));
print(is_prime(4));
print(is_prime(5));
print(is_prime(6));
print(is_prime(7));
```

### Built-in functions

#### print
The print function prints the value of the expression passed to it. It returns the value of the expression passed to it.

```Rust
let two = print(1+1);
```

#### time
Returns the current time in milliseconds.
```Rust
let t = time();
```

## Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Limitations

What is this it, and what is it not?
The goal is not to create the next big language that everybody should use. This is more of an experiment in making a minimal compiled functional programming language.

I will work on this in my spare time. No guarantees can be made.
