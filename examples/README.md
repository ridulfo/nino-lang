# Examples
There are many examples of nino-lang programs. This directory has a number of programs. There are more programs in the [E2E test program](/tests/programs) directory. 

Feel free to run these examples using the interpreter (`ninoi`). To do so, you first need to build it using:

```bash
cargo build --release && mv target/release/ninoi .
```

Then run the program using:
```bash
./ninoi is-prime.ni
```
